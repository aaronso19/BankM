Assignment Summary:

In this project, we analyzed how likely a potential bank customer will sign up for term deposit or not.

Various classification models were used to analyze the data. It seems like Logistic regression is able to give us the best results.

Furthemore, with optimization techniques, it does not seems like we are able to improve the model much further.

The bank marketing department can deploy this model. When a new list of potential customer info is available, they can using this model to tell the likelyhood of whether the customer will sign up for term deposit, and only contact the potential customer who are likely to sign up, and in turn reduce the number of phone calls.
